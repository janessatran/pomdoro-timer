### What is The Pomdoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

### How to use the timer
Click the link above and set your "work sessions minutes" and "break session minutes". When your work session is complete, a bell will chime to notify you that your break session has started. You can pause the timer, play again, and reset as you need.
